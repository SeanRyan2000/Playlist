# Playlist
An application to allow a user to add song names to a list of items, sort them and then shuffle play them by printing out the names of the song 
 
This was built for an assisgnmet for CS4222 programming. This was created as part of a team with Sean Ryan (me), Eoin Costello, Andrew McMahon and David Woods.

To use this application, download the files and drag them into a new project on blueJ. If you right click on the files you will be able to add new songs and decide what order to play. Or you can just use the driver and it will give a sample of all the methods we used.
